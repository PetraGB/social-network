# Social Network

Web app build with React and Node where people can make personal profiles, find others, add them as friends and participate in a group chat. Project was done within two weeks during the SPICED bootcamp.

### Registration

Users can safely register, as the password will be properly encrypted before being stored in the database. Users can also add a picture and a bio to their profile, or edit those.

### Finding others

Using the search field, one can look up friends who have signed up before. Once you've found a friend, you can add them.

You can also accept requests of those who added you or unfriend current friends.
